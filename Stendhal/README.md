I use [bspwm](https://github.com/baskerville/bspwm), with lemonboy's [bar](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) (master branch).

Firefox+Vimperator, music player is ncmpcpp, terminal is termite, shell is zsh with a syntax highlighting plugin and the file manager is Thunar.

##Config files
*bspwmrc* goes into `~/.config/bspwm`

*bspwmpanel* and *bspwmpanel-bar* generate the content of the panel. Put them in your $PATH.

I've also included the `config.h` I use for lemonboy's bar, and the termite config file. The firefox userchrome is there too, but not the 4chan css.

##Mails
On my system, cron fetches mails every hours. I configured it to call `mailbox_to_fifo` after that.

    0 * * * * /usr/bin/getmail --rcfile mailbox1 --rcfile mailbox2 ; /home/tatou/.bin/mailbox_to_fifo

I also made an alias in .zshrc so that when closing mutt it refreshes the number of unread mails.

    alias mutt='mutt ; mailbox_to_fifo'

##Notifications

![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/notstat.gif)

The music notification on the left of the panel is generated by *not-stat*, a shitty shell script I wrote and use as a general purpose notification system, read the content of the file for more details. [Mpdcron](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1354247) calls `not-stat -m` each time the song changes.

I also configured sxhkd to call it after pressing various keybinds. Here's an example:

    XF86AudioRaiseVolume
     amixer set PCM 1dB+ ; not-stat -v

With those settings, pressing the XF86AudioRaiseVolume button will increase the PCM channel volume by 1 dB and then output the new volume value in place of the current song. The volume change notification will then disappear after 3 seconds (and get replaced by the current mpd song again).

Why the FIFO and not a simple while loop? Battery life is improved when I don't call acpi or mpc every couple of seconds.

##Font
In the panel, I'm using a modified MonteCarlo font with manually added icon glyphs. You can find it in my [Monégasque](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/Monegasque) repo.

The gtk font is Lucida Grande, the terminal font is Menlo.

##Misc
* I use compton to draw very subtle shadows and to fade windows when opening/closing them or when switching between tags.
* I use dmenu2 and center it in the screen like this:

    dmenu_run -i -x 415 -y 330 -w 450 -h 20 -l 4 -fn 'Lucida Grande-8' -nb '#201F1D' -nf '#eddec9' -sb '#8F3724' -sf '#eddec9'

* Gtk theme is tweaked from flatstudio.
