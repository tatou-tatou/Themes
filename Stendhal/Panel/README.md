#How to use?
![Left click](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/icon-leftclick.gif)

You will need [bar-aint-recursive](https://github.com/LemonBoy/bar) (for the panel) and [dzen](https://github.com/robm/dzen) (for the popups). bspwm is not required, but you will have to rewrite large chunks of the `panel` and `panel-monitor` scripts if you don't use it.

To have the same panel as me, put all the scripts in your $PATH. Sometimes, it might need another script I put in `~/.bin`, so look for it in the appropriate [place](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/tree/master/.bin).

There are a lot of scripts, so to keep things organized, I suggest you to make a dedicated location (`~/.panel` for example) where you would put all the panel related scripts. Of course, that location must be added to your $PATH.

*Note:* The BAR developper was lazy and haven't implemented a way to increase the maximum number of clickable areas dynamically, without recompiling. In the source code, there is a `#define N 20` somewhere, **increase** that value if you need more (if you use everything I did, the highest possible number of clickable areas at the same time is above twenty).

#####Fork
LemonBoy recently added support for other buttons than the left click. The way he did it was frustrating, so [I did it another way](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/bar) (read the commit [message](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/bar/commit/81861bcddcdb8ed30165d1913d2093fba6120b80)). The way I did it is very bad, but less useless. I will use my fork until he does it properly.

I also merged a patch made by [this guy](https://github.com/pentla/bar). With it, you can print the current x coordinate of the clickable area.

**I make an extensive use of those changes, so my full setup won't work if you are using the vanilla bar.**



#Core subdir
Without the content of this directory, nothing will work. `panel` and `panel-skeleton` are mostly copy-pasted from the bspwm example panel, with additional stuff and some removals. So, credits goes to Baskerville for those two.

##Start the panel
- To start everything, just launch `panel`, it will create the panel fifo and start bar.
- `panel-skeleton` interprets where to put each information that is piped to the fifo.
- `panel-settings` contains various settings, like the colors. It is loaded by the other scripts.

All the special characters (icons...) are custom made. You will need the *MonteCarloPanel* and *MonteCarloMedium* fonts from my [Monégasque](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/Monegasque) repo, or add the characters yourself to your font of choice.

If you want to use your own font with your own glyphs, just know that I had some issues with vertical alignment. I fixed it by duplicating my font and changing some of its properties (namely *SIZE*, *PIXEL_SIZE* and *FONT_DESCENT*) to align it properly. That's why I have both a *MonteCarloMedium* font and a *MonteCarloPanel* font, the later being dedicated to the panel.


##Workspaces
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/workspaces.gif)

The startmenu is made by mygtkmenu. It appears when clicking on the blank space on the left of the workspace list, but you can easily add an icon or more space by editing the appropriate line in `panel-settings`.

##Songs and system events
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/notstat.gif)

The music notification on the left of the panel is generated by *not-stat*, a shell script inspired by [statnot](https://github.com/halhen/statnot).

It will display a notification in the panel and show the music again if there is no new notifications during three seconds.

You call it like this:

    pkill not-stat ; not-stat -<x>

**Do not forget to kill the *not-stat* process before calling it**, else the three seconds wait will not work properly.

Of course, I could have written some lines at the beginning of the script to check if another instance was running, but using the above method is much simpler, much saner and avoid all of the possible race conditions issues that could arise with any other method.

###(Very) simple music controls
![Label](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/label-leftclick.gif)

- A left click on the label will toggle play/pause through mpc.
- A right click will open ncmpcpp.

The blue icon can toggle other things, read the *Monitor subdir* section.

*Note: this makes use of both left and right clicking, so it's* **not** *usable with vanilla bar! Refer to the first section.*

###Calling not-stat
####With mpdcron
On each song change or mpd event (like play/pause), [mpdcron](https://bbs.archlinux.org/viewtopic.php?pid=1354247) will execute the following:

    pkill not-stat ; not-stat -m &


####With sxhkd
It's also bound to keybinds, for example:

    XF86AudioRaiseVolume
        amixer set PCM 1dB+ ; pkill not-stat ; not-stat -v

With those lines in your sxhkdrc, pressing the *XF86AudioRaiseVolume* will raise the PCM channel volume by 1 decibel, display the new volume value and show the music status again after three seconds of inactivity.

Read my `sxhkdrc` if you want other examples. I use not-stat to tell me the remaining battery time when I need it for example.

####With buttons
The script is also called by the scripts in the `Monitor` subdir when clicking on various buttons or when using the different sliders. Read the next section.


#Monitor subdir
The directory include scripts both for bar and dzen.

For bar-aint-recursive itself,
- `panel-monitor` is called when you click on the blue icon. It provides controls for:
    * Setting the PCM channel volume.
    * Setting the Master channel volume.
    * Setting the current keyboard layout.
    * Setting the screen brightness.
- `panel-music` is a simplified panel-monitor, dedicated to music controls. Those appears when you **right** click on the blue icon.

For the dzen popups and their sliders,
- `dslider`creates the dzen popup and the fifo used by the sliders.
- `dslider-content` creates the actual content of the popup (sliders).

`not-stat` is necessary to update the slider indicator position when the popup is opened and if you are using *keybinds* to change the volume/brightness (and not just clicking on the slider). If you want to know why, look at what happen when you call `not-stat` with the -d, -v or -V argument.

*Note:* You **MUST** create a file called `~/.panel/PID/dzen-submenu.pid` (see the panel-settings). Else, the slider popup will have very strange behavior (not closing, won't update if you use keybinds to change the volume...)

*Note 2: All of the above scripts make a* **HEAVY** *use of the x-position patch to calculate where the popup should appear. They also use both left and right clicking. For those two reasons they are* **not** *usable with vanilla bar. Refer to the first section.*

##Panel-monitor
![Left click](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/icon-leftclick.gif)

All of this is made by `panel-monitor` and the two dzen scripts.

###Volume controls
Should work out of the box. I just use the CLI tools that come with ALSA to get and change the volume of the Master and PCM channels.

###Keyboard layouts
Obviously, if you want to use this you will have to adapt it to your setup. It uses `setxkbmap`, so reading its man page would be a good start.

You will want to edit the `layoutCmd` variable to fit your model of keyboard, the `for layout in Fr Us` and add a variable just like `Fr="AZERTY"` or `Us="QWERTY"` if you want more keyboard layouts. You must use valid layout names but it won't matter if they are upper-case (the `${layout,,}` will make them lower case).

The variable is just to have a message for not-stat (see the gif and the `layoutCmd` variable), it can be edited out if you don't use that.

###Brightness controls
To draw the slider, it reads the current screen brightness value in `/sys/<...>/backlight/<...>/brightness` and its max value in `/sys/<...>/backlight/<...>/max_brightness`.

The path to those files probably won't be the same on our respective systems, so edit this in `panel-settings`.

The same for [the script I use](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/mbp_backlight) to change the backlight. If you want to use it, you will need to adapt it to your system so it changes the value of the right file.

##Panel-music
A **right** click on the *blue* button will spawn `panel-music`:

![Right click](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/icon-rightclick.gif)

A right click on the then created *pink* button will let you toggle *repeat*, *random*, *single* and *consume* in mpd. A left click will either spawn `panel-monitor` or take you back to the normal music controls (if you were in the *repeat, random, etc* mode).

`panel-music` uses a script from my ~/.bin called `mpc-script`. You might want to replace the occurences of `mpc-script prev` by `mpc prev` (or just grab the currently unfinished `mpc-script` from my `~/.bin`). The mpc-script doesn't do much, it's just to combine in a single button both `mpc prev` (if you are at the beginning of the song) and `mpc seek 0%` (if you are not).

The dzen popup provides shortcuts to launch [mpdviz](https://github.com/neeee/mpdviz), *ncmpcpp* and my [coverart](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/coverart) script.

The coverart script is not that good and the new gif API broke `meh`, making it unusable right now anyway.


#Lists subdir
The content of that directory is half-made and subject to a lot of future changes.

##To-watch list
![Screenshot](https://raw.github.com/tatou-tatou/Themes/master/Stendhal/Previews/torrents.gif)

- `panel-torrents` displays the number of unwatched items in the panel. Clicking on that number spawns the popup (by launching `dzen-menu`). Clicking **again** closes it.
- `dzen-menu` creates the popup. Right clicking on the popup will close it.
- `dzen-menu-content` creates the content of the popup from a text file acting as a list.
- [This](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/notify-torrent-done) script (called by transmission-daemon when a torrent is finished), will add the filename at the end of the text file.


I use **rssdler** to automatically download torrents from rss feeds and to send me a notification when a new .torrent file is about to be downloaded.
I know rssdler can be run as a daemon, but I use `cron` and `rssdler -r` instead.

In the popup, clicking on the [X] will remove the associated line from the list.

Clicking on a file name will send it to **xdg-open**, so it should work with any file type. I chose to use xdg-open only out of lazyness, but it would be nice to have more control, especially for things like compressed files (personnally I want to use mcomix if it's a comic, but if it's not then opening it in a file manager would be a better solution).

The script assumes the file is inside your Torrents folder, if it's anywhere else it won't work.

For some reason, I cannot make it so that arrow keys can be used to navigate the list. I thought it was possible with dzen, so if someone have a solution, I'm very interested.

######To do
- Use something else than xdg-open.
- Make it work if the file is elsewhere than in the Torrents folder.
- Navigating with arrow keys.
- Rewrite a good part of the code as it's a hackish mess, especially what I do to "clean" after the popup closed, no matter *how* it was closed. I think I have found a partial solution (that I already use for the "slider" dzen popup) though. The script also contains remains from other scripts and lacks a good part of its end (it lacks support for the todo list).

##Todo list
It works exactly like the to watch list and the mounted devices list. It's unfinished and I haven't included it fully (yet), but it uses `dzen-menu` and `dzen-menu-content` too (like the to watch list).

It depends on `remind` to automatically add new tasks, or automatically remove the tasks that are out-of-date and cannot be done anymore.

##Mounted devices list
I haven't included it here. It's in my dotfiles repo though, and it works pretty well.

Appears when you do a right click on the date. It lists mounted devices and clicking on their name will open the file manager where they are mounted, while clicking on the [X] next to their name will unmount them.

It uses `udevil` and I use devmon to automount. I like devmon a lot, but udevil and it don't blend well with other programs (except [those written by the same dev](http://ignorantguru.github.io/spacefm/) obviously), so I might have to migrate to something else.

*Note:* This is the functional equivalent of one of my [dmenu scripts](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/dmenu_umount), except the dmenu script is obviously much simpler and cleaner.


#Misc subdir
##Mails
`panel-mail` is called by cron after it fetches mails with `getmail`:

    0 * * * * /usr/bin/getmail --rcfile mailbox1 --rcfile mailbox2 ; /home/tatou/.bin/panel-mail

You could also make an alias so it's called when you close mutt, so the number of unread mail can be updated:

    alias mutt='mutt ; panel-mail'

Alternatively, you can make a very small script like [this one](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/mutt-panel) and call it instead of mutt when you want to open your mail client (I combine both methods, the script is only used by my run-or-raise script).

In the panel, you can **click** on the icon to hide the number of unread mails.

A **right** click will open mutt (or focus it if it's already opened) through my `run-or-raise` script (it's in my [~/.bin](https://github.com/tatou-tatou/dotfiles/blob/master/.bin/run-or-raise)).

Technically, you are not forced to use mutt, the above script would work with any mail client that supports the maildir format.

##Calendar
Found it on Twily's [website](http://www.twily.info), tweaked it a little. It's the `dcal` script.

If you click on the date in the panel, the calendar will pop. If you click **again** on the date, it will disappear.
